## Visual Recognition

This code shows you how to use the node.js API for the Watson Visual Recognition service. Given an image, Watson looks for 
object in that image and attempts to recognize if it is a cat or dog based on custom classifier.

The code has two basic sections: 

1. The *main()* method. This is the entry point to the code. It creates the *VisualRecognitionV3* object and then invokes 
the *detectFaces()* method.

2. A set of default parameters and the code that runs this module if it is invoked by itself (as opposed to being invoked 
by a *require()* statement).

See the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_accessing_the_main_module) for more information 
on the implications of the *require.main === module* statement.

### Code Walkthrough
1. This code takes a URL of an image file as input, looks for object in that image, and attempts to identify as cat or dog. 
The call to the Watson Visual Recognition service is wrapped in a JavaScript **Promise** to handle the asynchronous nature 
of the service.

### Testing Instructions

1. Try other samples by putting the url containing image for **imageurl** in *testparams* :
* Dog: https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/PetSmart/PB1201_STORY_CARO-Authority-HealthyOutside-DOG-20160818?$PB1201$
* Another Cat: http://www.petmd.com/sites/default/files/what-does-it-mean-when-cat-wags-tail.jpg
